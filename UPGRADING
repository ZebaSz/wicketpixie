UPGRADING WICKETPIXIE

If you are upgrading from WicketPixie 1.0.1 or 1.0, you'll need to delete the
WicketPixie plugins from /wp-content/plugins/ and also delete the
/wp-content/uploads/activity/ folder. You will not have to do this with any
version of WicketPixie newer than 1.0.1.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.2+:

As of WicketPixie 1.2, major code changes will break the widgets for your
Social Mes (or Sources). To fix them, make sure to chmod 777 the widgets
directory and the file 'widgets/sources.php', then click on 'Regenerate Widgets'
in the WicketPixie Social Me Manager.
Due to the code changes in 1.2, you will also lose all your saved options. Be
sure to write them down if you need to before upgrading.
One last thing you must do before upgrading to WicketPixie 1.2 is deleting an old
table from your WordPress database. The table will have the name of wik_adsense,
prefixed by whatever you have set as your WordPress database prefix. You can use
software such as phpMyAdmin to help you do this.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.3+:

In WP 3.0+, we now use the built-in function, so the old background won't work. Just
re-upload the image (or enter the colour hex) via the WordPress background settings
page. The rest should work just as it did before.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.4+:

In this version, some BIG changes were made which WILL break some of your configuration.
Please read this carefully. If you're in doubt, just make sure to write down all of your
data, then proceed.
All custom code options were condensed in one page, and now use simpler, unified
functions. Home Custom code had a different way to store data, so you will lose it
with this upgrade. Write it down, then add it back in the custom code admin page. It
was renamed as "After-Home-Meta".
Some WiPi plugins were removed to reduce bloat.  All plugins removed can be installed
via the Plugin Manager, which also auto-updates them. However, their configurations as
WiPi plugins will be lost. Please write them down before upgrading, then install and
configure said plugins separately.
To integrate AskApache 404 properly, follow that plugin's instructions using the new
custom 404 code option (instead of editing 404.php).
