UPGRADING WICKETPIXIE

If you are upgrading from WicketPixie 1.0.1 or 1.0, you'll need to delete the
WicketPixie plugins from /wp-content/plugins/ and also delete the
/wp-content/uploads/activity/ folder. You will not have to do this with any
version of WicketPixie newer than 1.0.1.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.2+:

As of WicketPixie 1.2, major code changes will break the widgets for your 
Social Mes (or Sources). To fix them, make sure to chmod 777 the widgets
directory and the file 'widgets/sources.php', then click on 'Regenerate Widgets'
in the WicketPixie Social Me Manager.
Due to the code changes in 1.2, you will also lose all your saved options. Be
sure to write them down if you need to before upgrading.
One last thing you must do before upgrading to WicketPixie 1.2 is deleting an old
table from your WordPress database. The table will have the name of wik_adsense,
prefixed by whatever you have set as your WordPress database prefix. You can use
software such as phpMyAdmin to help you do this.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.3+:

The only feature I know will break is the custom background (in WP 3.0+), since
we now use the built-in function. Just re-upload the image (or enter the colour hex)
via the WordPress background settings page.
The rest should work just as it did before. If you find any problem, make sure to file
a bug in the link provided in the README.
