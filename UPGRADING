UPGRADING WICKETPIXIE

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.3+:

We now use the built-in custom background function, so the old background won't work.
Just re-upload the image (or enter the colour hex) via the WordPress background settings
page. The rest should work just as it did before.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.4+:

This version requires WordPress 3.0 or newer.
In this version, some BIG changes were made which WILL break some of your configuration.
Please read this carefully. If you're in doubt, just make sure to write down all of your
data, then proceed.
All custom code options were condensed in one page, and now use simpler, unified
functions. Home Custom code had a different way to store data, so you will lose it
with this upgrade. Write it down, then add it back in the custom code admin page. It
was renamed as "After-Home-Meta".
Some WiPi plugins were removed to reduce bloat.  All plugins removed can be installed
via the Plugin Manager, which also auto-updates them. However, their configurations as
WiPi plugins will be lost. Please write them down before upgrading, then install and
configure said plugins separately.
To integrate AskApache 404 properly, add that plugin's function call using the new
custom 404 code option (instead of editing 404.php).

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.5-a:
This version requires WordPress 3.4 or newer.
Some big changes have also been made in this version which require some configuration.
The "Theme Options" page has been removed for Wordpress 3.4+ in favor of the Theme Customizer.
Previously stored theme options, however, should still work.
The custom code admin page no longer offers editors. Files to be included must be uploaded.
Uploaded files can be edited through the WordPress Theme Editor. Also, there is a new
custom file folder, so old files will not be detected, and must be re-uploaded.
There is now only one feed widget, which allows you to select the source, instead of
one widget per source.
WiPi plugins have been fully deprecated. This is because some of them were old, and it proved
tiresome to update them. More information is available in the WicketPixie Admin help tab.
