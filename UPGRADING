UPGRADING WICKETPIXIE

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.3+:

We now use the built-in custom background function, so the old background won't work.
Just re-upload the image (or enter the colour hex) via the WordPress background settings
page. The rest should work just as it did before.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.4+:

In this version, some BIG changes were made which WILL break some of your configuration.
Please read this carefully. If you're in doubt, just make sure to write down all of your
data, then proceed.
All custom code options were condensed in one page, and now use simpler, unified
functions. Home Custom code had a different way to store data, so you will lose it
with this upgrade. Write it down, then add it back in the custom code admin page. It
was renamed as "After-Home-Meta".
Some WiPi plugins were removed to reduce bloat.  All plugins removed can be installed
via the Plugin Manager, which also auto-updates them. However, their configurations as
WiPi plugins will be lost. Please write them down before upgrading, then install and
configure said plugins separately.
To integrate AskApache 404 properly, add that plugin's function call using the new
custom 404 code option (instead of editing 404.php).
