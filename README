THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING WICKETPIXIE

ABOUT THIS FORK

WicketPixie 1.2 is outdated and no longer under development. 2.0, on the other hand,
is a full re-write, which at the time of this fork (March 2011) lacks many features
available in prior versions. The aim of this fork is to pave the way to WicketPixie
2.0 by providing backports. Also, I have some great ideas in mind to add to this
WordPress theme.
This is an unoficial fork, and I'm not related in any way to the original
project/developers of this theme. However, some changes (such as i18n support) might
be pushed upstream for 2.0, according to Eddie Ringle (the current maintainer).

If any bugs were to be found, please report them in the fork's code repositoty below.

REQUIREMENTS

This theme was designed for WordPress 3.0+ and PHP5. It might work (to some extent)
with previous WordPress versions, but requires at least 2.8. However, we recommend
that you use the latest versions available. At the time of writing,
the latest WordPress is 3.1, and the latest PHP is 5.3.5.

INSTALLING

Just place the wicketpixie folder in your /wp-content/themes/ directory and
then activate the theme. Then make sure the httpd user has write access to
the widgets folder and it's contents (chmod -R 0777) and the app folder
(chmod 0777). Remember, if your web server uses the same user that owns
the WicketPixie files, there is no need to change permissions.
To use the bundled background in WordPress 3.0+, you need to upload them
with the themes settings page.
